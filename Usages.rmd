This is duplicate the vector into the rows of the matrix
You can also duplicate the vector into the columns of the matrix, just to change the byrow = F and specify the number of duplicates which is ncol and don't forget to specify the other dimension of the matrix.
```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
matrix(x, byrow = T, nrow = 10, ncol = length(x))
```
